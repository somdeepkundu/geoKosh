The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) uses natural areas to organize and conduct surveys throughout India. In the 75th round of the National Sample Survey (NSS), India was split into 88 natural regions based on contiguous districts with comparable physical features, rural population density, and agricultural patterns. These regions provide as a foundation for data collecting and research on a variety of socioeconomic factors.
